![Build-Push-And-Test Workflow](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/actions/workflows/build-push-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg)

This repo is part of the series of labs of the Course DevOps and SRE. Please refer to the inscruction in [Step 3](https://github.com/Horizon-School-of-Digital-Technologies/devops-sre-course/tree/master/step-3) of DevOps Labs.

This repo contains work from step 3 to step 8.

there is a problem with the last wabapp testing job with curl, it keeps sending requests endlessly that it cannot finish the job and workflow making me cancel it and stop triggering it so i meant to ask about it. Noting that i did step 8 work with code from steps 3 and 7. Perhaps that is why although the addresses are the same.
